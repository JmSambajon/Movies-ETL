# Movies-ETL

This project creates an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. This involved creating a function that takes in the three files Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data, and performing the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
